# UnicodeNormalization
This project aims to create a substitute for String.Normalize() from .NET, which unfortunately isn't supported in Portable Class Libraries (which includes Windows Phone projects).

The algorithm used comes directly from [unorm](https://github.com/walling/unorm), a JavaScript implementation, which is released under MIT/GPL licenses. This project itself is released under the MIT license.
